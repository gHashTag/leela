      'Life is a Game in which each of us plays a role. This game in India is Leela, and our Higher "I" plays it, creating the whole world of names and forms. Before us is an acting game created in ancient times and has come down to us through Harish Johari, an expert and keeper of the Indian mystical tradition. Yogis who have explored the labyrinths of human consciousness have established the existence of 72 basic states of being. These states correspond to the cells of Leela\'s playing board - "the periodic system of the elements of consciousness." Within the framework of these states, everyone acts in accordance with their karma, when the player completely penetrates into its meaning, having reached Cosmic Consciousness. The player rolls the die, allowing the forces of karma to determine his next position on the board. He goes through various planes of existence, rising along the arrows and descending with the snakes, seeking to comprehend the intention of his Higher Self wherever he goes.\nIf this is the first time you encountered this game, take it seriously. The more respectful you are with the game, the stronger your practice will be. A reverence for ends and means is essential for any spiritual growth and development. \nThe game must be over. Having entered the game, you need to get out of it, merging with the Cosmic Consciousness. Do you want to stop promoting at this level? Life goes on, and you will still remain in the same field. That is why the game is worth playing to the end.',

    title: 'Rules of Play',
    content:
      "Four things are necessary for playing Leela: the game board, a die (half a pair of dice), the commentary section of this book, and an object, such as a ring, that belongs to the player and is small enough to fit in the squares; this serves as the player's symbol during play. The rules are simple. Each player places his symbol in square 68, the square of Cosmic Consciousness. One by one, the players throw the die and pass it on to the player on the right (this conforms with the natural movement of upward-flowing energy).\nThe first player to throw a six moves to the first square, genesis, and from there to the sixth square, delusion. Until a six is thrown, the player must wait unborn in Cosmic Consciousness. Each time a six is thrown, at any stage in the game, the player rolls the die again. The exception to this is that a player who has rolled three sixes in a row (and has moved eighteen squares), and then rolls another number, must return to the place where he started before he began to throw the sixes, and move whatever number of squares is shown on the fourth roll. If, for example, a player throws three sixes and then another number on his fourth roll at the beginning of the game when his first six took him into play, he then returns to genesis (square 1) and counts forward the number shown on fourth roll. But if, instead, he rolls four or more sixes, he continues turns until a number other than six is shown, at which he moves the total number of squares he has thrown and passes the die.\nWhen the player's symbol lands on the base of an arrow, he moves the symbol upward along the shaft of the arrow to its tip. If he lands on the head of a snake, it swallows him and deposits him at the tip of its tail. In this way, egotism leads to anger and spiritual devotion leads to Cosmic Consciousness. Thus the player throws the die and moves back and forth and up and down the board, taking care to move through the squares in ascending numerical order.\nReturning to the sixty-eighth square is the object of play. If the player should reach the eighth level but pass by Cosmic Consciousness into the sixty-ninth, seventieth, or seventy- first square, he must wait to throw either the exact number required to land on tamoguna, the seventysecond square, or a lower number that would allow him to move one or two squares. From rajoguna, the seventy-first square, the throw of a one will return the player to earth, and back into the game. Play ends only when the player lands exactly on the sixty-eighth square, either by the arrow of spiritual devotion or by numerical ascension (such as being on square 66 and throwing a two).\nIn the course of play, the player will usually find that he has a characteristic pattern of landing on the same arrows and the same snakes. The game will take on its fullest meaning when the player reads and understands the commentaries, wherein are explained the meanings of each space, arrow, and snake.\nIf the player lands on square 69, the absolute plane, he cannot reach Cosmic Consciousness, which is square 68. In that case he has to reach square 72, where tamoguna can bring him back to earth, after which he can reach Cosmic Consciousness by gradual progression or by throwing a three and reaching spiritual devotion—the direct arrow to Cosmic Consciousness. While he is on square 69 he needs a three; on 70 he needs a two; on 71 he needs a one; all other numbers played by the karma die are",

    title: 'Introduction',
    content:
      'Originally called Gyana Chaupad (literally Gyan = knowledge; Chaupad = a game played with dice: so “Game of Knowledge”), the game Leela was designed by the seers and saints as a key to inner states and to learn the principles of dharma - usually called Hinduism. With its snakes and arrows and seventy-two squares representing seventy-two planes, the game provides a key to the knowledge of the Vedas, the Shrutis, the Smiritis, and the Puranas. Playing the game is playing with the manifested divine knowledge found in the aphorisms and doctrisms and doctrines of yoga, of Vedanta, and samkhya, which flows in the body of the Hindu tradition as philosophy and lifestyle. While playing, one automatically moves through different squares of the fame board. Each square has a name, representative of an inner state as a plane. Each name triggers the mind and brings the consciousness of the player to contemplate and ponder the concept behind the word as long as he stays in that square. After a few minutes of playing, the game board starts to play with the mind and intellect of the player - as well as the ego, the strong sense of self-identity, the “isness” of the player.\nNeither the author nor the date of origin of the game we now call Snakes and Arrows is known. As a general rule in the Indian literary tradition, the name of the author is considered unimportant. He is but a pen in the hands of God, a tool of expression; and so the name has not been recorded. The influences apparent in the formulation of the game point to an age of at least 2,000 years.\nThe copy used as the basis of this particular translation was preserved by the family of an author of commentaries, living in Uttar Pradesh about 150 years ago. The present author now has another older, but incomplete, copy of the game board in his possession, which he purchased in Rajasthan from an antique dealer. This copy is much older, but because it is not complete it was not used for writing this version of the commentaries.\nA book of chants containing schlokas accompanied the game board. With each toss of the die the player intoned the appropriate chant for the space in which he landed. The schloka described the nature and meaning of the space, represented by a square in the game board. Unfortunately, the book of chants has been lost, and it has become obligatory to write a commentary, showing the network of philosophical ideas indicated by the names of the squares and also introducing the method by which the game board can be used by those who are interested in knowing and playing the game. However, each Sanskrit term has a well-defined connotation within the context of the tradition from which the game sprang. In addition to these definitions, along with information obtained from saints (who played the game when they were young and when they joined their order) and the terminology used in the game board itself, some knowledge came to the author from his own family traditions. this forms the basis of the present commentaries.\nThe creators of the game saw it foremost as a tool for understanding the relationship of the individual self to the Absolute Self. Played at this level, the game enables the player to detach himself from the illusion that his personality is firmly fixed. He sees his life as an expression of the macrocosm. Not his identifications but the play of cosmic forces determines the fall of the die, which in turn determines the course of his life\'s game. And the purpose of this game he sees as nothing less than the liberation of consciousness from the snares of the material world and its mergence with Cosmic Consciousness.\nJust as one drop of water, taken from an ocean, contains all the elements present in the ocean that was its source, so too is human consciousness a microcosmic manifestation of Universal Consciousness. All that man can ever know already exists as a potential within himself. For all that man perceives is a product of his sensory organs.\nEvents in the phenomenal world trigger the five sensory organs (ears, skin, eyes, tongue, and nose). The affected sensory organ initiates in turn a biochemical process, which passes through the central nervous system to be manifested as variations in electrical activity in certain areas of the brain. This play of electrical energy is a gross manifestation of that aspect of consciousness called mind.\nThe mind presents sensory data to the intellect and ego for evaluation and action. It is from the sensory perceptions that all the desires arise. And desire is the essence of the game—the player would not play had he not the desire to play. Desires are the motivations of life: man lives to fulfill his desires.\nDesires can be grouped in three classes, depending on their nature: physiological, sociological, and psychological. The physiological desires are those necessary for survival of the organism. Eating, drinking, sex, and sleep are major physiological desires. The sociological are physiological desires colored by the social context. Rather than one house, a man wants five. His need is for one, the desire for five—a social overlay. His desire for objects of luxury and a better status in society, which he can easily get by display of his achievements, is something that is social, and these desires are different in all parts of the world. Psychological desires all stem from the desire for identification of the self, the ego. The desire for inner growth and spiritual achievements is also a product of the ego. How strange it is that through this path one can lose the ego altogether: the great egotism of becoming egoless.\nPhysiological needs are recognized by all societies. No restrictions are placed on their fulfillment. Sociological desires vary from society to society. Psychological needs are common throughout the planet, and include man\'s complexes and achievements, disturbances and honors. enjoyments and traumas.\nAll these desires result from sensory perception and the faculty we call mind. All are biochemical states of the organism: all desires express themselves inside the organism as chemical states. As they produce chemical states, so can they also be provoked by the use of chemicals.\nThe physiological desires are often called animal needs, for they are the desires man has in common with all other animals. Psychological desires are often called higher needs, for they are concerned with the attachment of ego and the sense of fulfillment that comes from complete identification with the object of desire.\nWhatever the source of the desire, the ego acts to fulfill it through five work organs (hands, feet, mouth, genitals, and anus). The action comes only after the sense perception, which was its source, has passed through the mechanisms of mind and intellect.\nEach action triggers a reaction. The quality of the action determines the quality of the reaction. The reaction is manifested as a change in working consciousness. Negative actions entrap the player; positive actions liberate. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap": this paraphrase of a Biblical saying points out the law of karma.\nAny action the player takes is proper as long as he realizes that all actions plant karmic seeds, which may not bear fruit for years. The fruits of karma may not even manifest in the present life but may submerge only to reappear in some future incarnation. It is these karmas from past lives that determine the course of personality development in the individual.\nThe real job of the player is to recognize these karmas and their effect on his being. From this awareness comes the knowledge required to raise his level of consciousness. This is the job of karma yoga. And the phenomenal world is the stage on which the Leela (divine game) of karma is staged.\nTo understand the phenomenal world we must, then, become scientists of the self, exploring the organization of our own consciousness, the planes on which we dwindle all our lives, the snakes that we encounter, and the arrows we find in our upliftment. It is here the game of Leela serves its highest purpose. For it is a map of the self, the playground of the One-becoming-many.\n',

    title: 'The meaning of the game',
    content:
      "Our perceptual world comes to us through the mechanisms of mind and intellect, which alter, color, and reject. Perceptions are received through organs that cannot perceive more than a millionth part of the total electromagnetic energy spectrum.\nThus the world that is known to us at any given moment is but one of an infinity of simultaneous events, any one of which could be perceived in an infinite number of ways because of the infinite number of possible organizations of mind and intellect. The possibilities are quite simply beyond comprehension.\nWestern science has specialized in the study of the sensory realm: the perceptual, phenomenal, material world. Its explorations have been carrying material science to a unifying point, a set of principles operating throughout the known cosmos. These principles transcend time and space. The light we receive from some galaxies is over 100,000,000 years old, yet it follows the same rules governing the light from our own sun, which is only nine light minutes distant.\nThese principles are expressed in formulas such as Е = me2 and 3А3 (the organizing principle of every diamond in the universe). From diversity we are approaching a unity, expressed in the formulas of the physical sciences.\nThe Western mind has created a periodic table of the elements, which lists 103 fundamental organizations of matter. This is the essence of the West's understanding of the phenomenal world.\nEastern man, however, pursued a different course. In India, particularly, a temperate climate and the easy cultivation of crops did not force him to devote his energies to the struggle for survival that motivated the development of natural sciences in the West. Eastern man worshipped nature as a kind Mother principle and did not develop a conquest of nature that would prevent his own survival. The scientific spirit of Indian sages and seers turned inward to investigate the complexity that is human consciousness. Hence the science of tantra, yoga, and the ideas expressed in the Upanishads.\nAs general principles were discovered operating in the phenomenal world, so too were principles discovered in the operation of human consciousness. Yogis explored the labyrinth of the self and discovered seventy-two primary states of being. These states are the squares of the game of Leela, a periodic table of consciousness.\nWithin the seventy-two states, man acts out his karmic drama, play ending only when he attains total understanding of the game—Cosmic Consciousness. Play can be interrupted by the cessation of the principle of desire, but without a complete understanding of the game the true end of the game does not occur: desires are seeds of karma, and they can sprout any time they find suitable conditions to germinate. The player tosses his die, letting the forces of karma determine where he lands. He moves through the spaces and the various planes, up arrows and down snakes, until he is able to vibrate harmoniously everywhere, in all spaces. Ups and downs must lose their meaning.\nThe tossing of the die provides the variable link between the player s symbol and its movement across the game board. It is in the fall of the die that the principle known as synchronicity operates. Synchronicity is a term coined by the psychologist Carl Jung to explain the links that sometimes form between two seemingly unrelated events in the phenomenal world. Synchronicity is the fulfillment of a need by some agency outside the conscious control of the individual self. It is most easily understood in the context of interpersonal relationships. In a sense, synchronicity is being in the right place at the right time; and in reality, it is a continuous process.\nIn the game of Leela the need is understanding, the knowledge of how and where the player is experiencing at a given moment. The outside agency is karma, which determines the fall of the die. Leela is a game of synchronicity. Synchronicity simply means that all events in the phenomenal world are related and can be understood in their relationship if only a proper link can be forged. This game is such a link.\nTo strengthen the link, the player supplies an object of personal meaning to represent himself on the board. This is his symbol, and it moves across the board in accord with the tossing of the karma die. What is important is the pattern of movement of this symbol across the board. To understand this pattern—and the nature of the stages through which the player travels—it is necessary to understand more of the thinking on which the game board is based.\nThere is no death in this game. There are ups and downs, and changes in vibration levels, but there is no death. The spirit that is the individual self playing Leela does not die. It is the symbol, the body, moving across the game board with the toss of the karma die, which changes form. The individual self is a portion of the Lord, a limited manifestation of Cosmic Consciousness, the Supreme Self. The Divine dwells in the inmost being of man and cannot be extinguished. There is a vital unity of soul and body in man, as in the symbol and the player. The end only comes when the player reaches Cosmic Consciousness, the eternal state, the path from which there is no return. Here the player becomes the divine existence, beyond all modes and qualities. This is liberation. Death is change in form, not in spirit. It does not even exist on the material plane, because matter also is neither created nor destroyed but only changes form. Change of form is not real; it is a transitional phase in the world of phenomena, which is also an aspect of the Supreme, a reflexion of the Supreme Self. The cosmic process is an interaction between the two principles of Being and not-Being.\nIf we look at this game as a microcosm, we will find the complete octave of the macrocosm. As in a living organism the energy moves from plane to plane, from conception to birth, childhood to adolescence, youth to old age during a span of years, so the player operates from seven psychic energy centers moving up and down from chakra to chakra, and there are corresponding observable changes in his gross behavior.\nHuman life is a series of cycles: seven days for establishing conception, that is, for establishing the chemical nature; seven months to complete the formation of the body in the womb; and the seven major cycles of seven years each—the length of a complete lunar cycle—during which one moves through each of the psychic centers. In the game of Leela each of these seven cycles constitutes one horizontal row. The first center is the first row, and so on.\nIn the first cycle, to the age of seven, the player is too much himself— self-centered.\nIn the second cycle, seven to fourteen, he starts relating to a group of friends and living in the realm of fantasy. Attraction to the opposite sex, development of the aesthetic sense, and an interest in the fine arts also start at this age.\nIn the third cycle, fourteen to twenty-one, he wants to establish his identity. He wants power and affiliates himself to a group or ideology.\nIn the fourth cycle, twenty-one to twenty-eight, he begins to develop a sense of responsibility. He can now understand about others and appreciate their attributes.\nIn the fifth cycle, twenty-eight to thirty-five, he starts instructing others from his own experience and assumes the role of a teacher, often with the responsibilities of parenthood.\nIn the sixth cycle, thirty-five to forty-two, he becomes an observer of his own energy patterns and reviews his past karmas in the light of experience\nIn the seventh cycle, forty-two to forty-nine, he is generally well settled and lives his life with the aim of finding and merging with truth.\nThis is the normal course of human development, but the environment into which the player is born dominates his pattern of thinking to a very high degree—and the karma die leads a player into the mouths of so many snakes of attachment that many people spend the whole of their lives on lower levels. There are others for whom all snakes seemingly vanish, and arrows magically appear to boost them to their goal in four or five moves.\nThe seven planes through which the player must pass before he reaches the eighth plane —the plane beyond all planes—are the seven chakras. Normally, energy would flow through these centers in a pattern synchronous with the vibrational rhythm of the player. During every twenty-four-hour period, life energy passes through all the seven chakras. At sunrise it is in the third chakra, and after sunset it comes to the seventh. Thus the energy is influenced by solar, lunar, and gravitational forces. But since few of us can live a pure and natural existence, complex blocks are formed in the energy pathways. It is not able to flow regularly and properly through the organism, creating a disparity between the mental and the chronological ages.\nEach chakra has particular characteristics that enable the player to determine where he is vibrating at any given moment, particularly with the help of this game.\nThe first chakra is located at the base of the spine, midway between the anus and the genitals. Individuals vibrating here are insecure and are primarily concerned with physical survival. The sense of smell is dominant. The element of the first chakra is earth-the grossest manifestation of reality-and its color is yellow. The main problem of this chakra is violent behavior, which can arise from deep-rooted insecurity. However, the same insecurity can be a positive factor, as the motivating force behind the development of material technology. First-chakra people sleep ten to twelve hours nightly, on their stomachs.\nThe first chakra appears as the physical plane, the fifth square on the first row of the game. It is the plane of genesis, maya (the illusory perceptual world), anger, greed, delusion, conceit, avarice, and sensuality. When a player enters into the game he has to pass through these nine squares. There are no arrows to lift him out of the first chakra, because these aspects of the first chakra are fundamental to human existence. If he does not feel concerned with society's value judgments, then he will know that all these things are important for human life. But if he is concerned with the world and its judgments, then he will say, 'Well, anger is very bad. Greed is very bad. Vanity is very bad. All these things are very bad.' They do create disharmony and bad body chemistry, increase selfishness, destroy inner peace, and so on, but as Shakespeare reminds us, 'there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.' If we look deeper, from the point of view of survival (toward which firstchakra consciousness is oriented), we will see that without attachment, without greed, without a craving to find something more, life stagnates. If there were no anger and no vanity, the fun of the theater (Leela) would be lost. These various moods and temperaments provide color, the basic impetus for individual development. They are thought to be bad things, because they are connected with the lower, animal self. But we must see that they are also responsible for the growth and development of our rational, human, and divine self.\nBy mastering the first chakra the yogi obtains freedom from disease. By overcoming basic hang-ups he becomes open to knowledge, and no longer asserts himself so much. He learns to abstain from lower desires and attachments. Tantric scripture says he can become invisible if he wishes to.\nIn the second chakra, the player is caught up in the perception of his sensory organs. It is located in the region of the sex organs, with taste being its dominant sensory mode. Water is its element, and so it is characterized by luminous white or light blue. The principal problems associated with this chakra are corruption and disorder, ensuing from the loss of energy that comes from overindulgence in the sensory domain, and fantasy. But this same sensuality is the impelling force responsible for all the creative arts. One who vibrates in the second chakra sleeps eight to ten hours nightly in the fetal position.\nThe second chakra contains two arrows—purification and mercy— and two snakes— jealousy and envy. It contains the astral plane, the plane of fantasy, and the plane of joy. Here are found nullity and also entertainment, the essence of the spirit.\nBy mastering the second chakra the yogi becomes generally beloved. He can command the love of any animal or beast and can control the elements. He is freed from all his enemies and illuminates like the sun. He becomes well versed in prose, poetry, and reasoned discourse and can conquer lustful desires. The main problem of this chakra is exertion of power, imposing the will of the ego on others. The positive attribute is the organizational skill generated out of the altruistic use of power. One who vibrates here generally sleeps six to eight hours nightly on his back.\nThis third chakra is the celestial plane, and it contains three arrows— selfless service, dharma, and charity. There is one snake-bad company.\nIt is the plane of sorrow, good company, atonement, and karma.\nBy mastering the third chakra one is able to destroy sorrow and disease and gain knowledge of different lokas (worlds). One develops the healing power. It is a chakra of stability, accumulation of power, accomplishment, command, control, and the worldly achievements necessary to ground one's ego.\nIn the fourth chakra the player becomes aware of karmas, the behavioral patterns of his life. He is vibrating from the heart region, the seat of the celestial wishing tree. The heart is the abode of the conscious principle—the life—and seat of prana. This chakra is the center of the seven: three are above and three below. Thus the heart chakra is influenced by higher and lower forces simultaneously. Air is the associated element, the color is smoky gray-green, and the sensory mode is tactile.\nThe main problem of the player here is a tendency toward imbalance, spending too much time trying to rectify that which was. Faith (bhakti) is the motivating force in his life. He sleeps on his left side, five to six hours nightly.\nThis is the plane of balance, and apt religion is the arrow that takes the player higher. The snake is irreligiosity, which takes the player back to delusion. Here are the planes of sanctity, fragrance, and taste. Here also are purgatory, good tendencies, and clarity of consciousness.\nBy mastering the fourth chakra the yogi becomes like Jupiter, the lord of speech. His senses are completely under control. He is dearer than the dearest to women. His life is inspired, and poetry flows in his speech like a stream of clear water—uninterrupted. Scriptures say he is able to transfer himself to another body. His very presence is inspiring, and he has no enemies. He gains the power to become invisible, and unnoticeable, and he can levitate at will. He is able to see objects of both the visible and invisible universes and has the ability to travel any part of the world by the exercise of his willpower. He gains mastery over time.\nIn the fifth chakra the player has realized compassion and wants to share with others how he has been able to resolve those karmas he has confronted. This chakra is located in the throat, at the junction of the spinal cord with the medulla oblongata. It is the chakra of gyana (also spelled jnana)—knowledge. The player becomes a knower, a gyana (jnani). Without formal instruction and study he becomes knowledgeable of all scriptures (shastras). He is constant, gentle, steady, modest, courageous, and free from diseases and sorrows. He is merciful toward everybody; he has no expectations. The main problem is authoritarianism: 'This is the only way.'\nBeyond the realm of the senses, this chakra is the center of akash\n(ether). The elemental color is smoky purple. The player who vibrates here meditates on soham (so = that; aham = I am): 'That I am'—the sound his breath makes as he inhales\n(so = sound of inhaling) and exhales [ham = sound of exhaling). His obsession is logic, and his boon understanding. His intellect becomes free from the impurity of worldly pursuits, and he can see past, present, and future within himself. Meditation upon the pit of his throat enables him to overcome hunger and thirst and to achieve steadiness. He sleeps four to five hours nightly, changing sides.\nThe fifth chakra is the human plane, and right knowledge and gyana(jnana) are the arrows that can take the player up. Ignorance is the snake. It is the plane of the positive, negative, and neutral life-breaths (prana, арапа, иу ana). Here he is born as Man (a representative of higher consciousness as opposed to animal nature), and gains the understanding of energy, Agni (fire).\nOne who masters the fifth chakra can rejuvenate himself at will. His presence opens one to the knowledge of the Self, and in it one is able to understand the mysteries of nature and recognize the presence of divine knowledge in every existing phenomenon.\nIn the sixth chakra the dominant concern is tapasya, the austere task of raising consciousness ever higher. This is the center of command (agya, also spelled ajna) over movements. The player vibrating here has no problems. He is beyond seeing any possibility as a problem. He is centered in the third eye, the region of the pineal gland. He meditates on the sound От, and on the sound of his breath, which he now hears as hamsa (ham = I am; sa = That) 'I am That.' There is a difference between soham and hamsa. In soham the yogi is in duality—he relates himself to the Supreme Consciousness, saying and feeling that That (Supreme Consciousness) I (individual consciousness) am. In the sixth chakra the duality dissolves, and undivided unity establishes itself in his consciousness. He is no more himself the individual, but he realizes that he is the Supreme Consciousness. He dwells in that union and meditates on his true nature. He is beyond the realm of the elements.\nConscience is the arrow here, and violence the snake. In this, the plane of austerity, we understand the operation of the solai; lunai; and neutral currents. Pingala and ida, which are the carriers of solar and lunar currents, come up to here from the mooladhar chakra and go to the nostrils, right and left, functioning with the breath. A carrier of neutral currents and kundalini, sushumna moves into the Sahasrara. From this plane, spiritual devotion— bhakti — can take the player directly to Cosmic Consciousness, the only direct path to liberation in the game, beyond both earth (the place of refuge) and the liquid plane (the plane of fluidity).\nhe player who masters this chakra obtains great psychic powers, and all karmas earned by him during different lives in the past are destroyed.\nIn the seventh chakra the player is beyond all pleasure and pain.\nHe dwells in the thousand-petaled lotus at the crown of the head. Scriptures mention that one who establishes himself here in the seventh chakra becomes a master of eight siddhis: (1) anima, the power of becoming, (2) mahima, the power to enlarge, (3) garima, the power to become heavy, (4) laghima, the power to become light, (5) prapti, the power of reaching anywhere and everywhere, (6) prakamya, the power to realize all wishes, (7) ishatva, the power to create, and (8) vasbitva, the power to command all. These powers, or siddhis, make him siddha-purusha, a real master, who by will can create anything. He does not become inert or inactive but is filled by the light of Supreme Consciousness and bliss. But it is here that egotism can overtake him, and the siddhis, which are a great asset, can prove fetters; or inertia, tamas, can draw Ыт down to illusion. On realizing the plane of reality he can experience positive and negative intellect—the latter a snake, which draws energy down to the second chakra. This is the plane of happiness, the gaseous plane, the plane of radiation, and the plane of primal vibrations.\nThe eighth horizontal row is beyond chakras. The seat of Cosmic Consciousness, it is the plane of the Absolute. Each of these nine squares is a God-force: the phenomenal world, inner space, bliss, and cosmic good. There are three phases of energy, which manifest with creation: (1) the dynamic/positive, (2) the inert/negative, and (3) equilibrium — rajoguna, tamoguna, and sattoguna. Tamoguna is responsible for evolution; sattoguna for dissolution or liberation. If Cosmic Consciousness is not realized, the player has to descend to earth to rejoin Leela until he achieves liberation by reaching and landing in Cosmic Consciousness. Tamoguna takes him back to earth, the playground of karma, where he must work his way back up from the sixth chakra.\nLeela is the nature of Supreme Consciousness, the playful nature.\nThe phenomenal world is manifested Leela. The play is beginningless as well as endless. Leela is the great adventure and the great discovery. Again, and again, and again, and again—without any loss, and without any gain—this endless game is played. Those who realize the play in the game are not caught by the game board and know it as the Leela (divine game) of Leela-Dhar (Cosmic Consciousness). Those who identify with the squares and planes of the game board are played by the game board; and the game board becomes maya, the great veiling power that binds the mind. It is maya that creates the phenomenal world. It is Leela that makes it a great adventure. Tamas brings the player to maya—and boundless love and spiritual devotion to Cosmic Consciousness. Spiritual devotion is the great discovery in the game board of Leela, created by maya of Supreme Consciousness in order to enjoy himself—to play hide and seek with himself. There is no purpose and no responsibility in Leela. In the words of Maharishi Raman:\nThe ideas of purpose and responsibility are purely social in nature and are created by mind to exhort Ego. God is above all such ideas. If God is immanent in all and there is no one except him, who is responsible for whom?\nCreation is expression of inherent laws in the source of creation.\nThis inherent law is the playful nature of the Divine, which is Leela.",

      'The Indian tradition ascribes great significance to nine basic numbers, 1 to 9. Each number corresponds to a set of basic attributes, which contain keys to understanding the workings of the subtle life-force in gross manifestation. This is the teaching brought to the West by the Greek Pythagoras, a student of the Arabic version of Indian numerology.\nIn fact, not only do numbers count, but they give an account of the countless idea-forces working through human consciousness and the phenomenal world. They help the mind to have a definite idea of the perceptual world. In this beginningless creation there is neither first nor last, because all is one number. Actual digits are only the manifested forms, which appear as evolution starts and disappear or merge in their source with the dissolution of the phenomenal world. Everything that exists is disposed according to number, each a part (ank) of the whole (Brahman, Supreme Consciousness) manifesting himself. The whole is boundless, countless, no number, zero, shoonya — non-Being—which is the start of Leela, the cosmic play.\nAt the beginning is the separation of Being from non-Being. Sound, naad, is the first to evolve. Sound contains the twin aspects of sound and bear. Sound represents energy in its original vortex form. Beat is a pattern of vibration experienced in linear form. Sound creates space, and beat creates time. Each sound has a wavelength, and each wavelength exists in time. The measurement of a wavelength is the time that the wavelength takes from its origin to the end.\nPlato regarded numbers as the essence of harmony and harmony as the basis of both cosmos and man. Balzac, the French novelist, called the numbers "incomprehensible agents." According to him, distinctions between different forms of existence are differences in their qualities, quantities, dimensions, forces, attributes, and nature. These differences are not in the essence, but in the material content, which is arranged in different patterns. These patterns, when observed closely, vary only in numbers. The difference between an atom of copper and one of gold is but a difference in the number of particles they contain.\n\n72 71 70 69 68 67 66 65 64\n55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63\n54 53 52 51 50 49 48 47 46\n37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45\n36 35 34 33 32 31 30 29 28\n19  20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27\n18  17  16  15  14  13  12  11  10\n1    2    3    4    5   6    7   8   9\n\nThe arrangement of the playing board of Leela is based on a foundation stone of numerology. The board is a numerologically balanced perfect rectangle. It contains eight horizontal rows from bottom to top. Eirght is the number of the manifested universe, prakriti, which is composed of the five elements, or mahabhutas (ether, air, fire, water, and earth) and the three forces—mind, intellect, and ego (manas, buddhi, ahamkar). The vertical columns from left to right total 9, the number of the Absolute, Supreme Consciousness (the eight of prakriti plus one—Consciousness). Nine is the completion of the series of simple (basic) numbers and is therefore the number of completion. Thus there are seventy-two squares making up the field of cosmic play. Seventy-two when reduced to a simple whole number again becomes 9 (7+2 = 9).\nIn the serpentine motion of play, the start of each horizontal column begins with a number reducible to 1 and ends on a number that reduces to 9. For example, the second horizontal row begins with 10(1 +0 = 1) and ends on 18(l+8=9).In addition, each horizontal row contains nine numbers, which when added together yield the number 9. The first row totals 45 (4 +5 = 9), the second 126 (1 +2 +6= 9), the third 207 (2+0+7=9).\nEach vertical column, except the central one, contains just two basic numbers. The first column consists of l8 (1 +8 = 9), 19(1 + 9= 10 = 1), 36 (= 9), 37 (= 1), 54 (= 9), 55 (= 1), and 72 (= 9). The second vertical column yields 2s and 8s, the third 3s and 7s, the fourth 4s and 6s, and the fifth the only exception—all 5s. From here the order reverses (6s and 4s, 7s and 3s, 8s and 2s). So each vertical column, except for the middle, contains two fundamental integers, which when added together produce 1. The central column, the column of balance, contains 5s; and two 5s yield 10 or 1. In addition, the sum of each vertical column is 292, which becomes 4(2 + 9+2= 13 = 1 +3 -4),the number of rational organization, tangible achievement, tetramorphs, the formless square.',

      '1. Dharma is an internal law inherent in all phenomena of this world, supporting its integrity. This is not just a set of beliefs that have nothing to do with reality, but principles that serve as the basis for a harmonious and prosperous life. This is a practical teaching. The word comes from the Sanskrit root dhar, which means "to support, to bind together." \n2. The Vedas are divine, perfect knowledge, omnipresent and supporting the entire manifested world. This knowledge was received by the rishis (saints, seers, yoga adepts) in a state of samadhi. This knowledge is contained in four scriptures: \nRig Veda, \nYajurveda, \nSama Veda, \nAtharvaveda. \nEach Veda consists of three parts: \nSamhita - a collection of hymns or mantras. \nBrahmanas, which contain instructions for the use of various mantras and ceremonies. Dedicated mainly to rituals, they also contain many instructive stories, philosophical observations and deep ideas. \nUpanishads are philosophical treatises based on the interpretation of knowledge left by those rishis to whom this knowledge was revealed. \n3.Shruti are streams of cosmic vibrations that fill space and possess magical powers. They contain knowledge about the order in which the energies of this world were set in motion during its creation, and how this order is maintained by the Cosmic Consciousness. The Vedas are Shruti. \n4.Smriti is a practical application of divine knowledge and laws inherent in objects and phenomena of the created world. These treatises contain laws that make our life divine. There are many Smritis, of which four are recognized as the main ones: \nManu-smriti, \nYajnavalkya-smriti, \nSankhya-smriti, \nParasara-smriti. \nThe Vedas are Shruti, and all books discussing the various positions of the Dharma are Smriti. These books form the foundation of the Hindu tradition laid down by the ancient seers. \n5. Puranas follow Shruti and Smriti. They illustrate the philosophical teachings set forth in the Vedas, using the example of specific cases and historical facts. The richness of allegories and metaphors inherent in the Puranic style allows one to explain the highest philosophical truths in simple human words. For this reason, the Puranas are also called the "fifth Veda." \n6.Yoga - literally means "to unite, unite, connect". It is a science dedicated to inner growth, bringing calmness and developing the ability to stop the constant fluctuations and changes in the workings of the mind, which are the main cause of human suffering. It makes it possible to rise above the sensory level to the spheres of habitual concentration, undivided attention, eternal peace and enlightenment. There are many schools, each of which offers its own ways and methods for improving the body and mind. Among the general goals of yoga schools, one can note the unification of the solar and lunar principles, control over the autonomic nervous system, etc. In general, yoga can be divided into three large areas: \nKarma yoga is the yoga of selfless actions. \nJnana yoga - yoga of cessation of mental vibrations through denial, leading to absolute truth. \nBhakti yoga is the yoga of devotion, love and surrender. \nAmong the famous schools of yoga are the following: \n-Raja Yoga - yoga of the eightfold path (yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi). \n-Hatha Yoga - Yoga that trains the senses by working with the body. This practice helps to achieve the goals of Raja Yoga. \n-Nada Yoga - Yoga that works with the sounds of the inner world. \n-Laya Yoga-dissolution in the flow of cosmic vibrations; also known as kriya yoga and kundalini yoga. \n7. Vedanta is a philosophical doctrine, also called uttara-mimansa, and is currently dominant in Hindu thought. Vedanta is concerned with the study of the nature of the Self and the distinction between real and unreal. It points to the unity behind the variety of objects and phenomena, and gives knowledge of the true nature of things. Vedanta teaches how from the thought of the individual “I”, which seems to be separated from the Higher “I”, one can come to an understanding of the fundamental unity of the first and the second, that all “I” are part of the One Great “I”, Brahman. Vedanta says that a person can achieve oneness with Him and, moreover, understand that he is and has always remained the Cosmic Consciousness, separated from himself by a veil of illusion. This is the science of the “I” existing outside the qualities, proclaiming the principle “You are That (the Great Single“ I ”)." \n8.Sankhya - a description of the order of the creation of the world. The doctrine of the evolution of the manifested world. \n9.Sloka is a Sanskrit verse stanza. \n10.Karma yoga is the yoga of selfless actions (karma means “action”). Actions include everything performed by an individual from the moment of birth to death. The player, attached to his actions, uses any means to achieve his goals and, blinded by selfishness, harms others. The one who is not subject to such attachment performs his actions insofar as they are inevitable; he follows his karma with detached interest and never resort to false means. Karma a, performed by the right means, does not harm anyone and is in accordance with the laws of the Dharma. Dharma is a law inherent in the player who performs karma according to the tendencies of his mind.\n2. Vedas: divine knowledge, perfect knowledge, which is omnipresent and sustains all that is manifested. This knowledge is directly realized by rishis (saints, seers, yogis) through samadhi. This knowledge is available as four scriptures:\na. Rig Veda.\nb. Yajur Veda.\nc. Sama Veda.\nd. Atharva Veda.\nEach Veda has three generally recognized divisions:\na. Samhitas: collections of hymns or mantras.\nb. Brahmanas: containing precepts for establishing the mantras and ceremonies. They are treatises on rituals but are interwoven with many illustrative stories, philosophica observations, and profound ideas.\nc. Upanishads: philosophical treatises, based on interpretations given by rishis to whom this knowledge was revealed.\n3. Shrutis: cosmic sound frequencies, floating in the cosmos as richis (incantations) revealed to rishis (visionaries). They contain the knowledge of the system by which the energies were vitalized in the universe at its beginning and are still directed by Cosmic Consciousness. Vedas are Shrutis.\n4. Smiritis: practical application of divine knowledge and laws inherent in the objects of the manifested universe. These treatises contain laws that make life divine. They are numerous, but four of them are very much quoted by scholars as the chief Smiritis:\na. Manu Smiriti.\nb. Vagya Valka Smiriti.\nc. Shamkhya Smiriti.d. Parashara Smiriti.\nVedas are Shrutis, and all books dealing with the law of dharma are the Smiritis from which the basic structure of Hindu tradition was built by seers.\n5. Puranas: next in order after Shrutis and Smiritis. They illustrate the philosophy of the Vedas through stories (from history) of those whose lives reflected the practical application of the law of dharma. They are allegorical in nature and explain the highest philosophy in a very human way. This is the reason the Puranas are called the fifth Veda.\n6. Yoga: literally, to join, to unite, to add, union. It is a science of inner growth, which gives peace and the capability to stop mental fluctuations and modifications, which are the root cause of sufferings, miseries, and pain. It provides the ability to rise above the realm of the senses into habitual one-pointedness, undivided attention, perpetual peace, and enlightenment. It has numerous schools, which suggest and provide, each in its own way, methods for an overall development and growth of physical body and psyche (union of solar and lunar principles, control over the autonomic nervous system, etc.). Broadly it can be divided into three branches:\na. Karma yoga: yoga of selfless action.\nb. Gyana yoga: yoga of cessation of mental modifications by negation, reaching the ultimate truth.\nc. Bhakti yoga: yoga of devotion, love, and surrender.\nFamous schools of yoga include\na. Raja yoga: yoga of the eightfold path—yama, niyama, asana, pranayam, pratiyahar dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.\nb. Hatha yoga: yoga that deals with the training of the senses by working with the body. It helps in achieving the goal designed by raja yoga.\nc. Naad yoga: yoga that deals with the sounds of the inner world.\nd. Laya yoga, and cosmic sound; also known as kriya yoga or kundalini yoga.\n7. Vedanta: the philosophical doctrine, also called Uttar Mimansa that dominates Indian thought to the present day, dealing with the nature of the self and discriminating between the real and unreal. It explains unity in diversity, the knowledge of noumena. It teaches one to climb from the idea of the individual self, which seems to be a reality apart from Cosmic.\nConsciousness, to the thought that one is a part of the Supreme Self, the Brahman, and can unite with him; and finally that he is and ever has been the Cosmic Consciousness, veiled from himself by ignorance. Vedanta is the science of Self without attributes, and teaches "Thou art That."\n8. Samkhya: the system of numbers; primarily an account of how creation started. It deals with the evolution of the manifested world.\n9. Schloka: a Sanskrit verse.\n10. Karma yoga: the yoga of selfless action (karma means action). Actions cover all acts done by the individual from birth to death. A player who performs karma with attachment uses any means that serve his purpose and in his selfishness causes harm to others. One who is not attached to his actions, and performs actions because they are unavoidable, performs karmas with a disinterested interest and does not adopt wrong means. Karmas performed by right means do not harm anybody and are in accordance with the law of dharma. Dharma is inherent in the player\'s own nature, if he performs karmas that coincide with the natural bent of his mind.',
