üéÆ Life is a game in which each of us plays his role.

üïâ This game is called Lila in India, and our Higher Self plays it, creating the whole world of names and forms.

üì≤ Here is the online version of the [Leela Game](https://band.link/A4Iny?qr), in which we can play without social and physical boundaries in the mobile application [Leela Chakra](https://band.link/A4Iny?qr).

üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The game itself is from ancient times, which has come down to us through the connoisseur and keeper of the Indian mystical tradition - Harish Johari. Yogis who have explored the labyrinths of human consciousness have established the existence of 72 primordial states of being. These states correspond to the cells of the Lila playing board ‚Äî the "periodic system of elements of consciousness". Within these states, each player acts in accordance with his karma, and the game ends only when the player fully penetrates into its meaning, having reached Cosmic Consciousness.

üé≤ The player rolls a die, allowing the forces of karma to determine his next position on the board. He passes through various planes of existence, climbing arrows and descending with snakes, striving to comprehend the intention of his Higher Self wherever he goes.

üßê If this is the first time you have encountered this game, take it seriously. The more respectfully you treat the game, the stronger your practice will be. Reverence for the goals and means of development is necessary for any spiritual growth and this game is no exception.

‚ö†Ô∏è The game must be over. Having entered the game, you need to get out of it, merging with the Cosmic consciousness. If you quit playing and stay on some field, then ... do you really want to stop advancing at this level? Life flows on, and you will still remain on the same field. That is why the game should be played to the end.

![](https://leelachakra.com/resource/LeelaChakra/InfoAboutGameAndAuthors/images/kamskiy.jpg)

Programmer and creator of the mobile application [Leela Game](https://band.link/A4Iny?qr) and the first in ru-net course on [React Native](https://youtu.be/o8H-jcFtm5Q) and [AWS Amplify](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLth6QPteH5gvQPp614dA7330_JtlvxdPy), as well as the first Russian in the program for bloggers programmers [AWS Community Builders from Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/developer/community/community-builders/). Founder of the [JavaScript Camp](https://www.jscamp.app/ru) programmer school and the ethno-electronic project [PLAYRA](https://www.instagram.com/playra/). A red-certified producer of the musical show business of GUU with a thesis ‚ÄúClub promotion and the history of the club show business of Russia‚Äú with a diploma supervisor [–°–∏–Ω–∏—à–µ–π –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∏—á–µ–º](https://www.instagram.com/sinishalazarevich/), Dmitry began working with many historical figures of the club show business of Russia, about whom he wrote in his thesis: Gary Chaglasyan, Dima Ashman, Zhora Petrushin, Vsevolod Shcherbakov, Alexey Gorobiy, Mikhail Kozlov, Denis Popov.

Dmitry met the game Lila in 2012 in GOA, where he liked the idea that this game, like "Jumanji", is connected with the lives of real people and their goals.

After that, he became imbued with spiritual evolution and embarked on the path of yoga, where he received initiation and the spiritual name Brahma Svarupa, which translates as "the true manifestation of God", from guru [Sri Dayanand Puri](https://avatarfest.com.ua/master/guruji-shri-dayanand-puri/), who holds a high post in the [Juna Akhara](https://www.advayta.org/nasha-traditsiya/orden-dzhuna-akkhara/) order ‚Äì Ashtakosal Mahant. He is one of the leaders of the totality of all 16 Puri lines (Sola Mira), out of a total of 52 Juna Akhara lines (that is, more than a third). For example, above this post there is only a "Sri mahant" (in each of the "Mari" there are only a few Sri mahants) and a single "Head (President)" of Jun Akhara. By the way, Guru ji's teacher, Sri Machender Puri, is Sri mahant. The Juna-Akhara monastic Order is one of the seven most influential and oldest. Founded by Bhagavan Dattatreya, it was reorganized by Adi Shankaracharya into the order of Sannyasins.

Another guru who has influenced the Kamskis' worldview to a greater extent is Swami Vishnudevananda Giri, who also conducts the dharma light from the deity Dattatreya. This saint is our central deity. Our spiritual connection with Datta manifested itself after our entry into the Order, but this connection has always been there and there have always been blessings.

Playing with each other and friends, there was an experience that the Kamskys began to transfer to: Shakti Terrace, the Age of Aquarius, iSoul Club, the Open World, where they also began their joint DJ career in the music group [PLAYRA](https://www.instagram.com/playra/) organizing dance parties for yogis, people who embarked on the path of spiritual evolution.
