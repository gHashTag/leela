# Migration

What the 25 repositories held, what has been merged, and what is left.

## The inventory

25 repositories: 23 in `gHashTag`, one in `dharmaapp`, one in
`fullstackserverless`. No local checkout of any of them existed — only
marketing assets on the Desktop and one keystore in Dropbox.

### Game clients — six generations of the same code

| Repository | Last push | Commits | What only it has |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fullstackserverless/leelachakra` | 2020-12 | — | the original, React Native on JS |
| `gHashTag/leela-game` | 2023-04 | 9 | a `translations/` directory |
| `gHashTag/leela` | 2024-01 | **211** | **the published app**, `com.leelagame`, versionCode 77: Firebase, RevenueCat, Sentry, notifee, MobX, 10 locales |
| `gHashTag/LeelaChakraAiMobile` | 2025-01 | 6 | same `src/`, bare RN with Yarn Berry |
| `gHashTag/LeelaAiWeb3` | 2024-08 | — | same base plus web3 codegen, `LEELA-PITCH.md` |
| `gHashTag/NeuroLeelaExpo` | 2025-07 | **114** | Expo Router, NativeWind, Supabase + Neon + Drizzle, Apollo, Inngest, Vitest, 23 locale files |
| `gHashTag/NeuroLeelaAgent` | 2025-10 | 3 (squashed) | AI SDK + OpenRouter, `docs/plans` (72 plans in English), `docs/rules` |

### Services

`NeuroLeelaMobile` (despite the name: a Node/Docker/nginx server with
swagger.yaml), `neuro-leela-telegraf-bot`, `leela-chakra-bot` (grammY on
Vercel), `leela-server-graphql`, `LeelaChakraAi` (a Supabase project).

`leela-ai-backand` is **not part of this game** — it is a fork of Rhubarb Lip
Sync, a C++ lip-sync tool for a talking avatar. 86 MB that only shows up
because of the repository name.

### Web3

`smart-contract-leela` (`LeelaGame.sol`, `LeelaToken`, hardhat,
`address.json`), `leela-ai-web3` (an earlier cut of the same contracts), and
four iterations of one subgraph: `the-graph-leela` → `leela-ai-2` →
`leela-ai-3` → `leela-ai-4`. `leelaWeb3` was already an attempt at a monorepo
(`mobile/ server-graphql/ site/`).

### Content and web

`leela-chakra-nextjs` (Next.js landing), `leela-ai-site` (Docusaurus, 23 MB),
`leela-ai-frontend` (Vite, the front end for the lip-sync avatar),
`translate-leela` (19 languages), `dharmaapp/leelabook` (the Russian book of
rules, 78 markdown chapters).

## What the merge found

### The two apps play different games

This is the finding that matters most, and neither codebase documents it.

Traditional Leela has one rule about sixes with two halves: a six lets you
throw again, and three sixes in a row burn the run and send you back to where
it started.

- `leela` v6.5.1 — the app that is **live on Google Play** — implements the
  first half. `src/store/helper.ts:99` shows the extra throw; there is no
  three-sixes rule anywhere in the repository.
- NeuroLeela implements the second half. `handleConsecutiveSixes` resets on the
  third six; nothing grants an extra throw.

Neither shipped the complete rule. A player moving between the two versions is
playing a different game and would have no way of knowing.

The engine keeps all three variants and records the one in force on every
player and every move (`players.ruleset`, `game_steps.ruleset`), so adopting
the engine changes nothing until a surface deliberately migrates.

### The board itself never drifted

Every snake and every arrow is identical between the 2024 production app and
the 2025 rewrite — all twenty jumps, plus `54 → 68` and the refusal to move
past 72. Verified by reading `leela/src/store/helper.ts:137-217` against
`NeuroLeelaAgent/services/GameService.ts:231-283`. The board is safe to treat
as settled.

### The production die is not fair

`leela/src/store/DiceStore.ts:50` re-rolls whenever the die repeats the
previous value. That is not a traditional rule and it skews the distribution —
notably, it makes a run of three sixes nearly impossible, which may be why the
three-sixes rule was never missed in that version. Recorded as
`rerollOnRepeat` on the `legacy-mobile` variant, and off everywhere else.

### The content was more complete than expected

The plan texts survive in four places and, taken together, cover 22 languages
with all 72 plans and full body text in each. The English filenames in
`NeuroLeelaAgent/docs/plans` are the only complete numbering scheme, so they
act as the key that ties the other three sources together.

## Done

| Package | Contents | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `@leela/engine` | board, rules, three variants, replay | 52, 100% branch coverage |
| `@leela/content` | 22 languages × 72 plans, rules chapters | 101 |
| `@leela/db` | schema, row ↔ state mapping, move log | 12 |

The engine's behaviour is locked to the last shipped implementation, including
two quirks kept deliberately and marked in the code:

1. A third six sends the player to the fallback square, and that square is then
   run through the board rules — so a fallback onto a snake or an arrow moves
   them again.
2. A player waiting on 68 keeps their old `previous_loka` rather than having it
   reset.

Both have tests that will fail loudly if someone changes them by accident.

## Remaining, in order

**1. Secrets — do this first, it is the only irreversible risk.**
`~/Dropbox/KeyForMobileApp/leela/leela-my-release-key.keystore` is the single
copy of the signing key for `com.leelagame`. Without it the published app can
never be updated — a new listing would be the only option, losing every
install and every RevenueCat subscription. Put it in a password manager
alongside the keystore password and the `applicationId`. This has deliberately
not been automated: the key should not be copied around by a script.

**2. Migrations.** `packages/db` has the schema but no migration files. The
live data is in Firebase (`leela`) and Supabase (`NeuroLeela`), and a player
moving across needs `plan`, `previous_plan`, the sixes counters, their reports
and their `ruleset` set to `legacy-mobile`. Getting this wrong loses players'
positions on the board and their report history.

**3. `apps/mobile`.** Port `NeuroLeelaAgent`, switch it to `@leela/engine` and
`@leela/content`, then bring across RevenueCat, notifee and Sentry from
`leela`. Keep the `applicationId` and the bundle id.

**4. `apps/bot`, `apps/site`, `apps/docs`.** All three become thin: the bot and
the site call the same engine, and the docs site renders `@leela/content`
rather than keeping its own copy of the text.

**5. `packages/contracts`.** Take `smart-contract-leela` and the newest
subgraph (`leela-ai-4`) only. Archive the three older subgraph iterations.

**6. Archive the source repositories.** Twenty of the twenty-five have been
superseded. Archiving on GitHub is reversible and keeps every commit, which
matters for `leela` (211 commits) and `NeuroLeelaExpo` (114) — `NeuroLeelaAgent`
is a squashed import and does not carry that history.

## Repository sizes

`leela` is 400 MB, `LeelaAiWeb3` and `LeelaChakraAiMobile` 62 MB each. Assets
should go to git-lfs in the monorepo. History is not worth rewriting: the
archived repositories preserve it.
